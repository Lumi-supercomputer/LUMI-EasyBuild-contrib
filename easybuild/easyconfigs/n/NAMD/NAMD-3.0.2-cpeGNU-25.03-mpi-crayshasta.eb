description = """
NAMD, recipient of a 2002 Gordon Bell Award and a 2012 Sidney Fernbach Award,
is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation
of large biomolecular systems. Based on Charm++ parallel objects, NAMD scales
to hundreds of cores for typical simulations and beyond 500,000 cores for the
largest simulations. NAMD uses the popular molecular graphics program VMD for
simulation setup and trajectory analysis, but is also file-compatible with
AMBER, CHARMM, and X-PLOR.

This version of NAMD is compiled with MPI as the transport.
