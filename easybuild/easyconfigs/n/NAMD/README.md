## General information

NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance 
simulation of large biomolecular systems. Based on Charm++ parallel objects, 
NAMD scales to hundreds of cores for typical simulations and beyond 500,000 
cores for the largest simulations. NAMD uses the popular molecular graphics 
program VMD for simulation setup and trajectory analysis, but is also 
file-compatible with AMBER, CHARMM, and X-PLOR.
