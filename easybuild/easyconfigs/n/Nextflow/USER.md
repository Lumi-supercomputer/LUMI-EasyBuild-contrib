Nextflow needs Java, but Java is already installed in the system image on LUMI.
Other versions of Java can be installed via the 
[LUMI Software Library](../../j/Java), but keep in mind that some Java packages may
still select the system one over the one installed as a module.

Nextflow tends to write in its own installation directories and is therefore not very well suited
for installation via the traditional software managers. However, installation instructions that should
work on LUMI are easily found in the 
[Nextflow documentation, "Installation section"](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation).
