# SPLA - Specialized Parallel Linear Algebra

  * [SPLA repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/spla)

## General information

SPLA provides specialized functions for linear algebra computations with a C++
and C interface, which are inspired by requirements in computational material
science codes.

SPLA provides functions for distributed matrix multiplications with specific 
matrix distributions, which cannot be used directly with a ScaLAPACK interface.

## EasyBuild

  * [SPLA in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/CSCS/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/s/SPLA)

### Version 1.5.1 for CPE 21.08

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the CSCS one
