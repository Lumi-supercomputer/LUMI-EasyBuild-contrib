# Silo technical information

Silo is a library for reading and writing a wide variety of scientific data to
binary disk files. The files Silo produces and the data within them can be easily
shared and exchanged between wholly independently developed applications running
on disparate computing platforms. Consequently, Silo facilitates the development
of general purpose tools for processing scientific data.

It is used in the LUMI graphics stack, in ParaView and VisIt.
