### Version 6.3.1 for cpeGNU 22.08

-   The EasyConfig files are derived from those in the EasyBuilders repository, but
    support for AMD GPUs has been added.


### Version 7.0.1 CPU for cpeGNU 24.03

-   Made the layout more readable.

-   Corrected the homepage.

    Note that the main author, Pieter Ghysels, has left the national labs and is
    now working for AMD. It remains to be seen how this package will further evolve.
