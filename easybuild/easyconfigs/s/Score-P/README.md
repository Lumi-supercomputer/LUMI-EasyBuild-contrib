The Score-P measurement infrastructure is a highly scalable and easy-to-use tool suite for profiling and event tracing of HPC applications.

It has been created in the German BMBF project SILC and the US DOE project PRIMA and will be maintained and enhanced in a number of follow-up projects such as LMAC, Score-E, and HOPSA. Score-P is developed under a BSD 3-Clause License and governed by a meritocratic governance model.

Score-P offers the user a maximum of convenience by supporting a number of analysis tools. Currently, it works with Scalasca, Vampir, and Tau and is open for other tools. Score-P comes together with the new Open Trace Format Version 2, the Cube4 profiling format and the OPARI2 instrumenter.
