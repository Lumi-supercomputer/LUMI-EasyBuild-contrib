## General information

SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++ with 
scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It works by taking the
declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to generate the wrapper
code that scripting languages need to access the underlying C/C++ code. 
In addition, SWIG provides a variety of customization features that let you 
tailor the wrapping process to suit your application.
