description = """
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++
with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different
types of target languages including common scripting languages such as
Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages
also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java including
Android, Lua, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and R.

Several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket)
are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or
compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing
and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces
and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call
into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.

SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both
commercial and non-commercial projects.
