### Version 2.1.12 for CPE 22.08 and CPE 22.12

-   Based on the JSC easyconfig

-   Unload the cray-libsci module to prevent linking to the threaded version of
    libsci which is not needed. It avoid the double linking problem with 
    application that actually need libsci


### Trying 2.1.12.5 for CPE 23.09

-   Did not work: the bin/sz binary was not built, so reverted to plain 2.1.12.


### 2.1.12.5 for CPE 24.03

-   Still without `bin/sz`, but this executable does not exist anymore?

-   Added license information in May 2025.

-   May 2025: Version added with `cray-hdf5-parallel` which was somewhat nontrivial.
