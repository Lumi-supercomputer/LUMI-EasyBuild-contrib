# VCFtools instructions

VCFtools is a program package designed for working with VCF files, 
such as those generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. The aim of 
VCFtools is to provide easily accessible methods for working with 
complex genetic variation data in the form of VCF files.

At this point (August 2022) it is not clear how well this code is 
still maintained. There are very few recent commits, no releases,
and response on issues raised seems to be slow also.


## EasyBuild

-   [Support for VCFtools in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/v/VCFtools)

-   There is no support for VCFtools in the CSCS repository


### Version 0.1.16 for cpeGNU 21.12, 22.06 and 22.08

-   We started from the EasyBuilders EasyConfig file for the 2021b
    common toolchains and added some documentation and tests.

-   For the version for 22.06, a patch was developed based on a recent
    bug fix in the GitHub repository (and basically the only change
    since this release or in 3 years).

    
### Version 0.1.17 from 25.03 on

-   Trivial update of the 0.1.16 EasyConfig for 24.03, but the patch was
    no longer needed as this is now corrected already in VCFtools.
