    Given the licensing conditions of VASP, it is difficult to maintain in the regular EasyBuild repository.

The VASP EasyConfig files for LUMI are build upon those of the CSCS repository, with Makefiles 
specifically for LUMI.


### 6.4.1 

-   build01

    -   Some improvements to the Makefile, including stronger optimization and 
        different HDF5 library compared to the 6.3.2 version

-   build02

    -   Same improvements as for build01.


### 6.4.2

-   build01

    - Plain build with high optimization, but no source code modifications.

-   build02

    - A few patches to the source code to improve the disk I/O on LUMI which led to slow startup times. This is the recommended version.

-   build02 is a trivial port of build02 for VASP 6.4.2.


### 6.5.0

-   build01

    - Plain build with high optimization, but no source code modifications.

-   build02

    - A few patches to the source code to improve slow VASP startup times by improving the disk I/O on LUMI. This is the recommended version.
