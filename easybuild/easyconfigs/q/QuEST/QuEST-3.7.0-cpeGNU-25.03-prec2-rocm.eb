description = """
The Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit is a high performance simulator of
universal quantum circuits, state vectors and density matrices. QuEST
can be used by both C and C++, is open source, multithreaded, distributed
and GPU-accelerated. Needing only compilation, QuEST is easy to run both
on laptops and supercomputers, where it can take advantage of multicore
and networked machines to quickly simulate circuits on many qubits.

Note that when using this installation you should carefully check the
configuration that was used to build the library, e.g., from the
EasyBuild recipe stored in $EBROOTQUEST/easybuild.
"""

usage = """
After loading the module, you can test the compilation of an example
program included with QuEST as follows:
  * Copy the sources from $EBROOTQUEST/examples to your working directory:
    cp $EBROOTQUEST/examples/tutorial_example.c .
  * Compile using the Cray compiler wrapper:
    cc tutorial_example.c -o demo -lQuEST
  * Run the demo executable that was generated in the previous step:
    ./demo
