description = """
 BFD is a package which allows applications to use the same routines to operate
 on object files whatever the object file format. A new object file format can
 be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and adding it to the library.

 BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one for each
 object file format).

  - The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user. It manages memory
    and various canonical data structures. The front end also decides which back
    end to use and when to call back end routines.
  - The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world. Each back end provides
    a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to maintain its canonical
    form. The back ends also may keep around information for their own use, for
    greater efficiency.

  This package also include libiberty as most tools requiring libbfd also
  requires it.
