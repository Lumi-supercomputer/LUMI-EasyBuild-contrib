Gotcha is a library that wraps functions. Tools can use gotcha to install hooks into other
libraries, for example putting a wrapper function around libc's malloc. It is similar to LD_PRELOAD, but
operates via a programmable API. This enables easy methods of accomplishing tasks like code instrumentation
or wholesale replacement of mechanisms in programs without disrupting their source code.
