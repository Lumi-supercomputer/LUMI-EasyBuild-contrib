description = """
Global Arrays (GA) is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming
model. It provides primitives for one-sided communication (Get, Put,
Accumulate) and Atomic Operations (read increment). It supports blocking
and non-blocking primtives, and supports location consistency.

Starting with GA v5.4, ARMCI has been deprecated and replaced with
Communication runtime for Extreme Scale (ComEx). GA uses ComEx to abstract
inter-node communication operations. The default ComEx ports use MPI --- which
makes GA and ComEx portable for high-end systems. Most ComEx implementations
use on-node shared memory for faster intra-node communication.
