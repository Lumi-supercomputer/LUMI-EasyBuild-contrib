# Elk instructions

  * [Elk home page](https://elk.sourceforge.io/)


## EasyBuild

  * [Support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/e/Elk)

  * There is no support for Elk in the CSCS repository.


### Version 8.4.6 for CPE 21.12

  * Own development

  * Some scripts copied in the regular EasyBuilders EasyConfig are not installed
    in this version.

### Version 8.4.30 for CPE 22.06

  * Straightforward port of the 8.4.6 EasyConfig.

  * A few from the scripts from the `utilities` subdirectory are now included,
    but not `utilities/xps` as that still contains uncompiled C code so it is
    not clear what should be copied there or be built that is not yet built.

### Version 8.7.10 for CPE 22.08 and 22.12

  * The make.inc is generated by the EasyConfig.

  * Builds with support for Libxc and Wannier90.

### Version 10.3.12 for CPE 24.03

  * Derived from the 8.7.10 EasyConfig.
