## EasyBuild

  - [JAX support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/main/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/jax)

JAX is very sensitive to the ROCm version. It is therefore difficult to provide
easyconfigs for the very latest version JAX with the ROCm version currently
installed on LUMI.

### Version 0.3.20 for cpeGNU and cpeCray

  - The easyconfig and easyblock are derived from the official EasyBuilders ones.

### Version 0.4.1 for cpeGNU and cpeCray 22.08

  - The easyconfig and easyblock are derived from the official EasyBuilders ones.
