# JasPer

JasPer is part of the central software stack in the [LUMI-SoftwareStack](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/LUMI-SoftwareStack/tree/main/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/JasPer)
repository, but some packages require older versions than used in the central software 
stack.

  * [JasPer on GitHub](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper)

      * [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/releases)

  * [JasPer home page (outdated downloads)](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/)

## EasyBuild

  * [JasPer support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/JasPer)

  * [JasPer support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/JasPer)


## 2.0.33 for 22.06

  * This EasyConfig is present here because WPS 4.3.1 turns out to be incompatible
    with JasPer 3.0.4 used in the 22.06 stack.

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the University of Antwerpen one with a version
    bump and change of download location.
