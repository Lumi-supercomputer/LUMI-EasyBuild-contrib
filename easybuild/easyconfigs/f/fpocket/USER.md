# fpocket user information

The [fpocket package](https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket/tree/master)
only compiles with a rather high number of warnings, and the makefiles
used for building are rather buggy and not written for LUMI. Use at your own risk.
Fixing bugs is not the task of the LUMI User Support Team, but of the authors of the
package, and as this package is neither parallel, nor supports GPU compute, it is not
exactly the target software for LUMI and LUST cannot invest resources into it.
