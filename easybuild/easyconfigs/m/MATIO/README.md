## EasyBuild

-   [MATIO support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/MATIO)

-   There is no support for MATIO in the CSCS repository


### Version 1.5.23 for cpeGNU 22.08 and 22.12 (archived)

-   The EasyConfig is adapted from the EasyBuilder ones.

### Version 1.5.27 for cpeGNU 24.03

-   The EasyConfig is adapted from the previous one but with a
    switch to use CMake as the build system. Enabled shared library and
    HDF5. HDF5 parallel is used as MATIO is a Trilinos dependency and we
    use the parallel version to build Trilinos.
