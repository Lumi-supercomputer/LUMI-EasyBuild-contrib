## General information

MicroHH is a computational fluid dynamics code designed to simulate turbulent flows in the atmosphere using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Its capabilities span a range from highly idealized flows to realistic atmospheric boundary layers, incorporating all relevant processes, such as moist thermodynamics, radiation, land surface processes, and microphysics. The code is written in C++/CUDA and runs on both CPUs and GPUs.
