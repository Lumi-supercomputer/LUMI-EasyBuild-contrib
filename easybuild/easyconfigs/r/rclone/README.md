# rclone instructions

Rclone is written in Go but there are binaries available that are fully statically
linked and may run.

  * [rclone web site](https://rclone.org/)

      * [rclone downloads](https://rclone.org/downloads/)

  * [rclone on GitHub](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)

      * [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/releases)


## EasyBuild

  * [rclone support in the EasyBuilders repository]|(https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/r/rclone)

  * There is no rclone support in the CSCS repository


### Version 1.57.0

  * For now we simply download the binary and will see if that one works.
    The binary is fully statically linked.

  * If needed the new EasyBuild approach of compiling the package also
    works.

    Please contact LUMI support if you need the necessary EasyBuild recipes to
    do so.
