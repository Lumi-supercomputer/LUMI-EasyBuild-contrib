# RSPt instructions

  * [RSPt home page](https://www.physics.uu.se/research/materials-theory/ongoing-research/code-development/rspt-main/)
  
Note that getting access to the sources requires registration, so
a fully autmated install is not possible. One needs to get the
sources by hand and put them in a place where EasyBuild can find
them.

## EasyBuild

  * There is no support for RSPt in the EasyBuilders repository.
  
  * There is no support for RSPt in the CSCS repository.
  

### RSPt 20211004 for cpeGNU 21.12 and 22.06

  * The EasyConfig is our own development.
  
  * The 22.06 is not fully tested as the sources were not available
    to the author.

### RSPt 20230120 for cpeGNU 22.06 and 22.12

  * The RSPTmake.inc is generated by the EasyConfig
