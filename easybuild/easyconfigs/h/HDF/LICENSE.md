# HDF license information

The HDF libraries are distributed under a BSD-style open source license.
The license information can be found in the source files in a file called
COPYING. 
Until the link dies (as the package is no longer supported), a copy is
also [available on the web](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF/HDF_Current/src/unpacked/COPYING).

After installing and loading the module, the license file can also be found on the system 
as `$EBROOTHDF/share/licenses/HDF/COPYING`.
