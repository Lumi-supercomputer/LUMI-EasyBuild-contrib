description = """
AOCL is a set of numerical libraries optimized for AMD processors
based on the AMD Zen core architecture and generations. The tuned implementations of
industry-standard math libraries enable rapid development of scientific and high
performance computing applications.

Note that AOCL will conflict with the Cray LibSci library, so when using
this module you have to unload the cray-libsci module as otherwise the
Cray compiler wrappers will add LibSci to the libraries used by the
compiler.

Cray LibSci already contains BLAS, LAPACK and ScaLAPACK functionality and
should be your first choice. But this module may be useful if you run into
problems with the Cray LibSci library. Note however that software in the
LUMI stack is by default build with the Cray LibSci library, so your code
that relies on AOCL may not link correctly to any of the other modules
in the LUMI software stacks.
