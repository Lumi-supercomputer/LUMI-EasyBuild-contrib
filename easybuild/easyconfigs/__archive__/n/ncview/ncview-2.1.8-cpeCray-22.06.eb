description = """
Ncview is a visual browser for netCDF format files. Typically you would use ncview to get
a quick and easy, push-button look at your netCDF files. You can view simple movies of
the data, view along various dimensions, take a look at the actual data values, change
color maps, invert the data, etc. It runs on UNIX platforms under X11, R4 or higher.

Development of ncview is slow if not nonexistent, and version 2.1.8 is from 2017. Hence
the LUMI consortium cannot make any promises about compatibiliy with future versions of
the LUMI software stack.
