# NWChem instructions

-   [NWChem web site](https://www.nwchem-sw.org), but that one seems out-of-date as it
    does not mention the 7.0 versions.

-   [NWChem web site on GitHub.io](https://nwchemgit.github.io/)

-   [NWChem on GitHub](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem)

    -   [GitHub releases via tags](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/tags)


## EasyBuild

-   [Support for NWChem in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/n/NWChem)

-   There is no support for NWChem in the CSCS repository


### Version 7.0.2 for cpeGNU 21.08

-   The EasyConfig file is inspired by the EasyBuilders one but did need some
    reworking.
