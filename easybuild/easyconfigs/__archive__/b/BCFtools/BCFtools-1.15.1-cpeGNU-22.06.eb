description = """i
BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant Call Format (
VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, 
both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.

It used to be part of SAMtools, a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput 
sequencing data.

This version is compiled using GSL without OpenMP support, so no parallel BLAS etc.
