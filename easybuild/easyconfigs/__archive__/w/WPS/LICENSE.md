# WPS license information

*We could not find any license information on the
WRF Preprocessing System (WPS).*

However, the [WRF Users' Page](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) does
contain the ["WRF Public Domain Notice"](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/public_domain_notice.html)
which is a "light" version of the typical license document.

Citation of some WRF papers is also encouraged as can be seen on the
["How to Cite the WRF-ARW-Model" page](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/citing_wrf.html).
