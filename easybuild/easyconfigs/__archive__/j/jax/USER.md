JAX is very sensitive to the ROCm version. It is therefore difficult to provide
easyconfigs for the very latest version JAX that compile with the ROCm versions 
currently installed on LUMI.

JAX support for ROCm is still experimental and the easyconfigs are provided "as
is" by the LUMI User Support Team. Some benchmarks have shown that performance
is far from being on par with performance on NVIDIA hardware.
