description = """
The libvori library implements recently developed methods of Voronoi integration
as well as the compressed bqb file format into a small C++ library, which is
called “libvori” (“Library for Voronoi Integration”). In principle, libvori
enables other programs to include these approaches. The present version of
libvori is a very early development version, which is hard-coded to work with
the CP2k program package, in which I have recently implemented these two methods.
There is no well-defined interface or documentation yet. If you want to use
libvori in your code, please have some more patience
