description = """
Libxc is a library of exchange-correlation and kinetic energy functionals for 
density-functional theory. The original aim was to provide a portable, well 
tested and reliable set of LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA functionals.

Libxc is written in C, but it also comes with Fortran binding. 

It is released under the MPL license (v. 2.0). In all publications resulting 
from your use of Libxc, please cite:
