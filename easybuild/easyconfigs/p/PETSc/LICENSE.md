# PETSc License Information

PETSc itself is covered by a 2-clause BSD license. 
Information is available on the 
["License" page of the PETSc web site](https://petsc.org/release/install/license/#doc-license).

Note that PETSc relies on many other libraries, some of which have much more restrictive
licensing conditions so do not forget to check those in function of which components and options
of PETSc you use.

PETSc also asks users to cite relevant publications in function of the algorithms they are
using. See the
["Citing PETSc" section on the PETSc web site](https://petsc.org/release/#citing-petsc).
