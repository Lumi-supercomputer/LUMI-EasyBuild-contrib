# PLUMED user information

**After the March-April 2023 system update the EasyConfigs of PLUMED were replaced with 
two versions due to build problems on the updated system.**

-   `-cray-python-3.9.12.1` versions include Python support as before, with the
    `cray-python` module now loaded explicitly as a dependency.
 
-   `-noPython` versions have Python support disabled.
