## General information

ABINIT is a software suite to calculate the optical, mechanical, vibrational, 
and other observable properties of materials. Starting from the quantum 
equations of density functional theory, you can build up to advanced 
applications with perturbation theories based on DFT, and many-body Green's
functions (GW and DMFT).

ABINIT can calculate molecules, nanostructures and solids with any chemical 
composition, and comes with several complete and robust tables of atomic 
potentials.
