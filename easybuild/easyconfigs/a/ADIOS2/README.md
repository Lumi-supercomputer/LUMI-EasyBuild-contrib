### Version 2.7.1 for CPE 22.08

- Based on the JSC easyconfig


### Version 2.8.3 for CPE 22.12

- Based on the JSC easyconfig


### Version 2.9.1 fro CPE 23.09

-   Trivial port of the 1.8.3 EasyConfig.

-   But switched the homepage to the page on readthedocs as the old home page doesn't seem to
    be updated anymore.

### Version 2.10.1 for CPE 24.03

-   Trivial port, but took a nicer way of configuring the `configopts`.

-   Changed in May 2025: Turned profiling on as that is needed for VisIt.


### Version 2.10.2 for CPE 25.03

-   Trivial port of the 2.10.1 EasyConfig for 24.03, but added a versionsuffix
    to the version using `cray-hdf5` to make the differences clearer from the name.
