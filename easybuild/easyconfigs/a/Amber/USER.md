# Amber user instructions.

As we currently have no way to limit access to the source files (or a pre-installed
version of Amber for that reason) to users who have the right to use Amber on LUMI,
users will need their own license for the right version of Amber and download the 
source files to install Amber in your project space. 
See also the instructions in the technical documentation further down
the Amber page in the LUMI Software Library.

AmberTools is free but it still requires a registration to download the source files
which is why those need to be downloaded manually also at the moment.

We are interested in feedback, especially for the GPU version, where AMD developed the
port.
