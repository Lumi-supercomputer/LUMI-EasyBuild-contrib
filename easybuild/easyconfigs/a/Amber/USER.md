# Amber user instructions

Users who have their own Amber license can download and install the software for
themselves in their project space. In additon to this, a pre-installation maintained
and supported by CSC is available under `/appl/local/csc`. For usage instructions,
see the [CSC documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/amber/). **Note that the CSC
license allows only academic use by not-for-profit institutes and universities**.

See also the instructions in the technical documentation further down
the Amber page in the LUMI Software Library.

AmberTools is free but it still requires a registration to download the source files
which is why those need to be downloaded manually also at the moment if you intend
to install the software yourself.

We are interested in feedback, especially for the GPU version, where AMD developed the
port.
