# Amber license information

Amber is licensed software. In principle all academic use of Amber is covered by the
CSC license, also for non-Finnish academic users, but as we have no way to limit
access to only those users, for now Amber needs to be installed in your project
space and users need their own license for now to download the right version of
Amber.

AmberTools is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License with a
few components licensed differently. Amber itself has a separate license though.

Note that from April 15, 2023 license fees for Amber will change and Amber will
become free for all not-for-profit use. There is currently no clear definition of what
is meant with not-for-profit users (e.g., what for academic projects with an industry
partner who can make money from the IP generated with the help of Amber experiments).

Some information about all this is available on the
[Amber download page](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php).
