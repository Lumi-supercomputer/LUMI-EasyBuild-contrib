# Amber license information

Amber is licensed software. All *academic* use of Amber is covered by the
CSC license, also for non-Finnish academic users. See more details in the
[CSC documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/amber/).

AmberTools is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License with a
few components licensed differently. Amber itself has a separate license though.

Note that from April 15, 2023 license fees for Amber will change and Amber will
become free for all not-for-profit use. There is currently no clear definition of what
is meant with not-for-profit users (e.g., what for academic projects with an industry
partner who can make money from the IP generated with the help of Amber experiments).

Some information about all this is available on the
[Amber download page](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php).
