description = """
The library AOCL-Utils is intended to provide a uniform interface to all AOCL
libraries to access CPU features, especially for AMD CPUs. The library provides 
the following features:

 - Core details
 - Flags available/usable
 - ISA available/usable
 - Topology about L1/L2/L3

AOCL-Utils is designed to be integrated into other AOCL libraries. Each project
has their own mechanism to identify CPU and provide necessary features such as
"dynamic dispatch". The main purpose of this library is to provide a centralized
mechanism to update/validate and provide information to the users of this library.
