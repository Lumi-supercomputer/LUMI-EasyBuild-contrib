## EasyBuild

  * [BLIS support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/b/BLIS)

  * There is no support for BLIS in the CSCS repository.


### Version 3.1 for CPE 21.08

  * The EasyConfig file is a direct port from the EasyBuilders one

  * Some logic was added to select zen3 depending on the partition loaded to
    support cross-compiling.


### Version 3.2 for CPE 22.06 and 22.08

  * Trivial port of the EasyConfig file for 3.1.


### Version 4.0 for CPE 22.12/23.03

  * Trivial port of the EasyConfig file for 4.0
  
  * Did restrict the number of threads for the tests though as not doing so 
    resulted in frequent errors when compiling on the login nodes.
