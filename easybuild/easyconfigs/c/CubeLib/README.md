Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P, is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity. In addition, Cube can display multi-dimensional Cartesian process topologies.

The Cube 4.x series report explorer and the associated Cube4 data format is provided for Cube files produced with the Score-P performance instrumentation and measurement infrastructure or the Scalasca version 2.x trace analyzer (and other compatible tools). However, for backwards compatibility, Cube 4.x can also read and display Cube 3.x data.
