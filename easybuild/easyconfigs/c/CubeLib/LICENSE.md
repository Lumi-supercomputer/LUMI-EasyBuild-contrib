# CubeLib license

The CubeLib license agreement can be found 
[on the Scalasca web site](https://scalasca.org/scalasca/front_content.php?idart=1094).
It is partly a BSD-style license, but there are third party components included with
their own licenses.

From version 4.9 on, the license information can also be found in
`$EBROOTCUBELIB/share/licenses/CubeLib` after installing and loading the module.
