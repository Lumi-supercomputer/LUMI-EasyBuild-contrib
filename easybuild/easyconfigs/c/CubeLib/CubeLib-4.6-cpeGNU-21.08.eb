This module provides the Cube general purpose C++ library component and 
command-line tools.

Cube is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P. It is a
generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space consisting of
the dimensions

- performance metric
- call path
- system resource

Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree
can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity.
