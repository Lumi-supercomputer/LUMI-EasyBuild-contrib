description = """
CMOR was not designed to serve as an all-purpose writer of CF-compliant
netCDF files, but simply to reduce the effort required to prepare and manage
MIP model output. Although MIPs encourage systematic analysis of results
across models, this is only easy to do if the model output is written in a
common format with files structured similarly and with sufficient metadata
uniformly stored according to a common standard. Individual modeling groups
store their data in different ways, but if a group can read its own data,
then it should easily be able to transform the data, using CMOR, into the
common format required by the MIPs. The adoption of CMOR as a standard code
for exchanging climate data will facilitate participation in MIPs because
after learning how to satisfy the output requirements of one MIP, it will
be easy to prepare output for other MIPs.

NOTE: This module does not support the Python interface. It also does not
include CDAT.
