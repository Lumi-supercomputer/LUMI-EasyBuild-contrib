# License

Since release 3.0, CGAL is available under an Open Source license as 
well as a commercial license. 
Users choosing to use CGAL under the free-of-charge Open Source license 
have to comply to its terms, otherwise they have to buy a commercial license.
The Open Source license is a combination of the LGPL v3+ and GPL v3+ licenses,
with some components using the former and other components using the latter.

The [licensing conditions can be found on the CGAL web site](https://www.cgal.org/license.html).
